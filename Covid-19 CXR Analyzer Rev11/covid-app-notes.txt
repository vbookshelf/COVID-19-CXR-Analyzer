Notes


1- Please place the model inside the folder called ‘flask’.
2- In this code the model is named: exp145-best.pt

3- Go to this Kaggle dataset and download the folder called: yolov5
https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/v2-balloon-detection-dataset

4- In the yolov5 folder you will see two files: Dockerfile and requirements.txt
Delete these two files. Then take all the files and folders that are in the yolov5 folder and put them in the flask folder. By doing this the code becomes more reliable because the  working directory does not need to be changed during prediction.

5- A server with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs works best. (Ubuntu 18.04)
6- This app is using the offline version of yolov5.
7- The requirements that are specifically needed by yolov5 are at the bottom of the requirements.txt file (mentioned above).
8- This code includes a fix for the cv2 module download errors that happen when using a server.
